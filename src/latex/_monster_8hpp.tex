\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration of the \doxylink{class_monster}{Monster} class, representing an enemy spaceship in the game. 

This file contains the definition of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_monster}{Monster}} class, which inherits from the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_space_ship}{Space\+Ship}} class. The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_monster}{Monster}} class is responsible for managing an enemy spaceship\textquotesingle{}s properties and behavior in the game. It includes functionalities such as controlling the monster\textquotesingle{}s movement, direction, collision detection, and handling projectiles and explosions. Monsters can shoot projectiles, change direction, and trigger explosion effects upon being destroyed. The class interacts with the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_explosion}{Explosion}} class for visual effects and uses {\ttfamily sf\+::\+Clock} to manage timing for explosions.
