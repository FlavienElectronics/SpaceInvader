\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration of the \doxylink{class_explosion}{Explosion} class, simulating the explosion effect in the game. 

This file contains the definition of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_explosion}{Explosion}} class, which is responsible for simulating the explosion effect of a monster when it is destroyed. The explosion grows in size over time, starting with a single pixel and expanding into multiple pixels as the explosion progresses. The class manages the state of the explosion through a status attribute, and it is linked to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_monster}{Monster}} class to track the position and size of the explosion relative to the monster. The explosion can grow through different stages, representing different phases of the explosion\textquotesingle{}s visual effect.
