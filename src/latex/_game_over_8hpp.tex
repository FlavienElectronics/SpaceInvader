\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration of the \doxylink{class_game_over}{Game\+Over} class, responsible for displaying the "{}\+GAME OVER"{} message. 

This file contains the definition of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_game_over}{Game\+Over}} class, which inherits from the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_letter_group}{Letter\+Group}} class. The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_game_over}{Game\+Over}} class is responsible for displaying a "{}\+GAME OVER"{} message in the game, typically shown when the player loses or completes the game. It initializes a group of letters to form the "{}\+GAME OVER"{} text and positions them appropriately in the center of the screen. The class leverages the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_letter_group}{Letter\+Group}} class to manage the creation and positioning of each individual letter. The color and position of the text can be customized.
